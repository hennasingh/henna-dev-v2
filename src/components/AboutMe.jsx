          With a background in customer engineering, technical writing,
          developer advocacy and technical program management, I thrive at the
          intersection of technology, relationship building, and
          problem-solving. Currently pursuing a Diploma in Full Stack
          Development at Code Institute, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in
          JavaScript, React, Django, and database management to transition into
          engineering and product roles.

          Previously, I led developer engagement programs at MongoDB, launched
          community-driven initiatives, and worked closely with engineering
          teams to enhance developer experience. My ability to translate complex
          technical concepts into actionable insights, combined with my
          leadership in program management, equips me to drive innovation in
          software engineering and product development.
